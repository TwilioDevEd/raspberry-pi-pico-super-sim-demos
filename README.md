This repo contains the complete Internet of Things (IoT) application built while working through Twilio’s tutorials:

* [**Get Started with Super SIM and Raspberry Pi Pico: SMS Communications**](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iot/supersim/get-started-with-super-sim-and-the-raspberry-pi-pico)
    * [Source code](/sms-commands/main_sms_commands.py)
* [**Get Started with Super SIM and Raspberry Pi Pico: Data Communications**](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iot/supersim/get-started-with-super-sim-raspberry-pi-pico-data-comms)
    * [Source code](/data-comms/main_data_comms.py)
    * [Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com/) &mdash; this example requires a Beeceptor endpoint URL, or similar.

Use it either to save cutting and pasting code while following the guides mentioned above, or as the basis for your own [MicroPython](https://micropython.org) IoT application.

Please see the first guide for [installation instructions](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iot/supersim/get-started-with-super-sim-and-the-raspberry-pi-pico).
